#Importing Gutenberg's open files to LBRY's blockchain.

Dependencies upon running: (coming soon)

`The program should look for any publish with the exact naming convention ([title] - [author]:[fileType])
if it exists, it will skip that file.
The process should be indiscriminate, it will download the next file and can only be cancelled through closing
the window or stopping the program.
There is also the option when starting on how many books, to save on either bandwidth, or disk space.`

(Planned) example of use:

python lbry-gut [n]

[n] being optional on how many to download in this particular run of the script.
